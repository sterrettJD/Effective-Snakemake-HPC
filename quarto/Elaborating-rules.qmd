# What else can go in a rule?

We've covered how to provide inputs and outputs for a rule, but we can actually provide anything we want as parameters of a rule. These rule params can be accessed with curly brackets just like we access inputs and outputs. For example:

``` snakemake
rule count_ducks:
    output: 
        "ducks_file.txt"
    params:
        ducks=2,
        eggs=4
    shell:
        """
        echo "The {ducks} ducks laid {eggs} eggs!" > {output}
        """
```
